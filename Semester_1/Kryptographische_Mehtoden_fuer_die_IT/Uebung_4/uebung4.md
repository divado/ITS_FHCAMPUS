## 0. Intro
The following documentation will show how the hashes given in excercise 4 were analyzed and eventually cracked.

### 0.1 Given hashes

The following list contains the given hashes for exercise 4:

```

```

### 0.2 Installation of needed software

For the analysis of the given hashes the software hashid was installed. Hashid is a program wirtten in Python, which tries to identify hashes based on a regex ruleset.

```shell=bash
pipx install hashid
```

For the installation on a Ubuntu sytem `pipx` was used. `pipx` will manage the Python venv and make `hashid` globally available.

After identifying the hash type `hashcat` was used to crack the hashes with a dictionary attack.

```shell=bash
sudo apt install hashcat -y
```

`hashcat` was install through the Ubuntu repositories and `apt`.

## 1. Analysis

The following section will describe the process of analyzing the given hashes to determine their hash types.

### 1.1 Hashid

To try and determine the type of hash used the list of hashes was put into a `hashes.txt` file. 

The `hashes.tyt` file was passed to `hashid`:

```shell=bash
 hashid -e -m hashes.txt -o hashid.out
```

The `-e` flag is used to get an extended output with all possible hash types. `-m` is used to get the corresponding mode used by `hashcat` to try and crack the hash. The flag `-o` sets the outputfile for hashid.

The following is the output of `hashid`:

As we can see not all hashes could be identified with `hashid`. Additional research is needed to identify the missing hash types.

## 2. Cracking attempts

### Example 1

* Hash: `5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8`
* Password: `password`
* Hash type: SHA1

Password was found via Google on [md5calc.com](https://md5calc.com/hash/sha1/password).

### Example 2

* Hash: `ECprxlyOyUshcl60I9RBSQ==:3NfdMsGy2AAHhm27PTFe0A==`
* Password:
* Hashtype: `Base64(unhex(md5(password))):Base64(unhex(md5(salt)))`

Based on analysis from https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier and cracking attempts to identify the order of hash and salt.

### Example 3

* Hash: `0x102a6bc65c8ec94b21725eb423d44149:dcd7dd32c1b2d80007866dbb3d315ed0`
* Password:
* Hash type: `md5(password):md5(salt)`
* This is the same as the previous example, but the hash is in hexadecimal.
*

### Example 4

* Hash: `$2y$12$RjmAST8RecCMVv1DO4g9zOv3wQ4/vsHlWyC7FLBF/07WL9SzVeA.m`
* Password: `password`
* Hash type: bcrypt

The hash was identified and recovered using hashcat and the "rockyou.txt" wordlist.

### Example 5

* Hash: `GvkWX7r0M7mkLxQ743qaDQ==:0/xjqfLDZfAaeI5/s6zjlg==`
* Password:
* Hash type: `Base64(unhex(md5(password))):Base64(unhex(md5(salt)))`

Based on analysis from https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier and cracking attempts to identify the order of hash and salt.

### Example 6

* Hash: `0xf7c3bc1d808e04732adf679965ccc34ca7ae3441`
* Password: `123456789`
* Hash type: SHA1

The hash was found via Google on [md5calc.com](https://md5calc.com/hash/sha1/123456789). Even though Hashid identified the hash as Bigcrypt, the hash appears to be a SHA1 hash.

### Example 7

* Hash: `$2y$10$NqnZ8O1xz0UdArMymrPjoOy2.WwLVqfFYxc1rkwwZdw9.f140Wq72`
* Password: `password2020`
* Hash type: bcrypt

The hash was identified by hashid and cracked with hashcat and the top 1000000 passwords wordlist.

### Example 8

* Hash: `qoIP+jhQg+rY3SWAR+FdnZC/H0Gj86WoehIejMC71so=` (Salt: 1, N 2048, R 8, P 1, Length 32)
* Password: `hugo`
* Hash type: scrypt, saved in Base64

Passing the parameters into Google the type of hash was identified as scrypt.
Scrypt hashes can be cracked with hashcat by converting them to the following format: `SCRYPT:n:r:p:salt:hash` so in this case: `SCRYPT:2048:8:1:MQ==:qoIP+jhQg+rY3SWAR+FdnZC/H0Gj86WoehIejMC71so=`. Using the "rockyou.txt" the hash was cracked.

### Example 9

* Hash: `5ts7TXFWp/S2WqMEDXZXO/eEkIE=`
* Password:
* Hash type: `PepopleSoft`

Hashid identified hash type as PeopleSoft, Dictionary atttack as well as brute-force didn't yield any result.

### Example 10

* Hash: `64iGbek1bgraDo3VoxjOY4ftjKQj5yWujhG7UyDMCS4=` (Salt: 2, N 2048, R 8, P 1, Length 32)
* Password:
* Hash type: scrypt, saved in Base64

Passing the parameters into Google the type of hash was identified as scrypt.

### Example 11

* Hash: `$2y$10$fP0pAnFtqOaiOTfjLRGB1.rJU5RE1r/P1xcux8vHd6e1Zw2bJXe7y`
* Password:
* Hash type: bcrypt, Blowfish

Hash identified by hashid.

### Example 12

* Hash: `Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:957ed2442e3fece7bf7cfe1417115710:::`
* Password: `CLA80`
* Hash type: Dump from the Windows user database, with a blank LM hash, and a real NT hash

The type of hash was identified by its characteristic structure. Searching for the LM and NT part of the hash the blank LM hash was found on [yougottohackthath.com](https://yougottahackthat.com/insights/what-is-aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee).
The NT part of the hash was recovered using [ntlm.pw](https://ntlm.pw/).
